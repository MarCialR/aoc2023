       "\n",
       "One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of **network** of labeled nodes.\n",

In this example, start withAAA``and go **right** (R``) by choosing the right element ofAAA``,CCC``. Then,L``means to choose the **left** element ofCCC``,ZZZ``.
