       "\n",
       "One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of **network** of labeled nodes.\n",

       "\n",
       "After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out:AAA``andZZZ``. You feel likeAAA``is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reachZZZ``.\n",
