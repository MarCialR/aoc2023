He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you **borrow my boat** and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these [scratchcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard) as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won.\"\n",
