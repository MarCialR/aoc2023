Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon and
@ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon ---</h2><p>Thanks to your efforts, the machine parts factory is one of the first factories up and running since the lavafall came back. However, to catch up with the large backlog of parts requests, the factory will also need a <em>large supply of lava</em> for a while; the Elves have already started creating a large lagoon nearby for this purpose.</p>
<p>However, they aren't sure the lagoon will be big enough; they've asked you to take a look at the <em>dig plan</em> (your puzzle input). For example:</p>
<pre><code>R 6 (#70c710)
D 5 (#0dc571)
L 2 (#5713f0)
D 2 (#d2c081)
R 2 (#59c680)
D 2 (#411b91)
L 5 (#8ceee2)
U 2 (#caa173)
L 1 (#1b58a2)
U 2 (#caa171)
R 2 (#7807d2)
U 3 (#a77fa3)
L 2 (#015232)
U 2 (#7a21e3)
</code></pre>
<p>The digger starts in a 1 meter cube hole in the ground. They then dig the specified number of meters <em>up</em> (<code>U</code>), <em>down</em> (<code>D</code>), <em>left</em> (<code>L</code>), or <em>right</em> (<code>R</code>), clearing full 1 meter cubes as they go. The directions are given as seen from above, so if "up" were north, then "right" would be east, and so on. Each trench is also listed with <em>the color that the edge of the trench should be painted</em> as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#Numeric_representations" target="_blank">RGB hexadecimal color code</a>.</p>
<p>When viewed from above, the above example dig plan would result in the following loop of <em>trench</em> (<code>#</code>) having been dug out from otherwise <em>ground-level terrain</em> (<code>.</code>):</p>
<pre><code>#######
#.....#
###...#
..#...#
..#...#
###.###
#...#..
##..###
.#....#
.######
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the trench could contain 38 cubic meters of lava. However, this is just the edge of the lagoon; the next step is to <em>dig out the interior</em> so that it is one meter deep as well:</p>
<pre><code>#######
#######
#######
..#####
..#####
#######
#####..
#######
.######
.######
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the lagoon can contain a much more respectable <code><em>62</em></code> cubic meters of lava. While the interior is dug out, the edges are also painted according to the color codes in the dig plan.</p>
<p>The Elves are concerned the lagoon won't be large enough; if they follow their dig plan, <em>how many cubic meters of lava could it hold?</em></p>
