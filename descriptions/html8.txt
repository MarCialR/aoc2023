Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon and
@ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---</h2><p>You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about <em>ghosts</em> a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>One of the camel's pouches is labeled "maps" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of <em>network</em> of labeled nodes.</p>
<p>It seems like you're meant to use the <em>left/right</em> instructions to <em>navigate the network</em>. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!</p>
<p>After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: <code>AAA</code> and <code>ZZZ</code>. You feel like <code>AAA</code> is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach <code>ZZZ</code>.</p>
<p>This format defines each <em>node</em> of the network individually. For example:</p>
<pre><code>RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
</code></pre>
<p>Starting with <code>AAA</code>, you need to <em>look up the next element</em> based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with <code>AAA</code> and go <em>right</em> (<code>R</code>) by choosing the right element of <code>AAA</code>, <code><em>CCC</em></code>. Then, <code>L</code> means to choose the <em>left</em> element of <code>CCC</code>, <code><em>ZZZ</em></code>. By following the left/right instructions, you reach <code>ZZZ</code> in <code><em>2</em></code> steps.</p>
<p>Of course, you might not find <code>ZZZ</code> right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: <code>RL</code> really means <code>RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL...</code> and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes <code><em>6</em></code> steps to reach <code>ZZZ</code>:</p>
<pre><code>LLR

AAA = (BBB, BBB)
BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
</code></pre>
<p>Starting at <code>AAA</code>, follow the left/right instructions. <em>How many steps are required to reach <code>ZZZ</code>?</em></p>
