       "The sand has been falling as large compacted **bricks** of sand, piling up to form an impressive stack here near the edge of Island Island. In order to make use of the sand to filter water, some of the bricks will need to be broken apart - nay, **disintegrated** - back into freely flowing sand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The stack is tall enough that you'll have to be careful about choosing which bricks to disintegrate; if you disintegrate the wrong brick, large portions of the stack could topple, which sounds pretty dangerous.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Elves responsible for water filtering operations took a **snapshot of the bricks while they were still falling** (your puzzle input) which should let you work out which bricks are safe to disintegrate. For example:\n",

       "Each line of text in the snapshot represents the position of a single brick at the time the snapshot was taken. The position is given as twox,y,z``coordinates - one for each end of the brick - separated by a tilde (~``). Each brick is made up of a single straight line of cubes, and the Elves were even careful to choose a time for the snapshot that had all of the free-falling bricks at **integer positions above the ground** , so the whole snapshot is aligned to a three-dimensional cube grid.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "A line like0,0,1~0,0,10``represents a **ten-cube brick** which is oriented **vertically** . One end of the brick is the cube located at0,0,1``, while the other end of the brick is located directly above it at0,0,10``.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Because the snapshot was taken while the bricks were still falling, some bricks will **still be in the air** ; you'll need to start by figuring out where they will end up. Bricks are magically stabilized, so they **never rotate** , even in weird situations like where a long horizontal brick is only supported on one end. Two bricks cannot occupy the same position, so a falling brick will come to rest upon the first other brick it encounters.\n",
