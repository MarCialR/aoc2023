       "The ferry quickly brings you across Island Island. After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry dock. \"Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to **Desert Island** !\" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.\n",

       "\n",
       "You manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the **time** allowed for each race and also the best **distance** ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you **go farther in each race** than the current record holder.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually **toy boats** , each with a big button on top. Holding down the button **charges the boat** , and releasing the button **allows the boat to move** . Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.\n",

       "+ Hold the button for **1``millisecond** at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of1``millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of **6``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **2``milliseconds** , giving the boat a speed of2``millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of **10``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **3``milliseconds** . After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone **12``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **4``milliseconds** . After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone **12``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **5``milliseconds** , causing the boat to travel a total of **10``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **6``milliseconds** , causing the boat to travel a total of **6``millimeters** .\n",
       "+ Hold the button for **7``milliseconds** . That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. **0``millimeters** .\n",
