       "With your help, the Elves manage to find the right parts and fix all of the machines. Now, they just need to send the command to boot up the machines and get the sand flowing again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The machines are far apart and wired together with long **cables** . The cables don't connect to the machines directly, but rather to communication **modules** attached to the machines that perform various initialization tasks and also act as communication relays.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Modules communicate using **pulses** . Each pulse is either a **high pulse** or a **low pulse** . When a module sends a pulse, it sends that type of pulse to each module in its list of **destination modules** .\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There are several different types of modules:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       " **Flip-flop** modules (prefix%``) are either **on** or **off** ; they are initially **off** . If a flip-flop module receives a high pulse, it is ignored and nothing happens. However, if a flip-flop module receives a low pulse, it **flips between on and off** . If it was off, it turns on and sends a high pulse. If it was on, it turns off and sends a low pulse.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       " **Conjunction** modules (prefix&``) **remember** the type of the most recent pulse received from **each** of their connected input modules; they initially default to remembering a **low pulse** for each input. When a pulse is received, the conjunction module first updates its memory for that input. Then, if it remembers **high pulses** for all inputs, it sends a **low pulse** ; otherwise, it sends a **high pulse** .\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There is a single **broadcast module** (namedbroadcaster``). When it receives a pulse, it sends the same pulse to all of its destination modules.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Here at Desert Machine Headquarters, there is a module with a single button on it called, aptly, the **button module** . When you push the button, a single **low pulse** is sent directly to thebroadcaster``module.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "After pushing the button, you must wait until all pulses have been delivered and fully handled before pushing it again. Never push the button if modules are still processing pulses.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Pulses are always processed **in the order they are sent** . So, if a pulse is sent to modulesa``,b``, andc``, and then modulea``processes its pulse and sends more pulses, the pulses sent to modulesb``andc``would have to be handled first.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The module configuration (your puzzle input) lists each module. The name of the module is preceded by a symbol identifying its type, if any. The name is then followed by an arrow and a list of its destination modules. For example:\n",

       "\n",
       "In this module configuration, the broadcaster has three destination modules nameda``,b``, andc``. Each of these modules is a flip-flop module (as indicated by the%``prefix).a``outputs tob``which outputs toc``which outputs to another module namedinv``.inv``is a conjunction module (as indicated by the&``prefix) which, because it has only one input, acts like aninverter(it sends the opposite of the pulse type it receives); it outputs toa``.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "By pushing the button once, the following pulses are sent:\n",
